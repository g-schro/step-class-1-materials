======================================================================================================

This repo contains course materials for my YouTube course **Stepper Motors and
Robot Kinematics: Theory and Practice on STM32**.  This course consists of five
videos. The YouTube URL is:

Currently this repo just contains documents (stepper motor specification and
some background articles) that can be found
[here](external-docs/README.md).

There is another repo containing the code for this course. The URL is:

https://github.com/g-schro/step-class-1-code

This course is a follow-on to my base course **Bare Metal Embedded Software
Development: Theory and Practice Using STM32**. The code in this repo is an
enhanced version of the code developed for that course. The YouTube URL for that
base course is:
